SUTD 50.021 Artificial Intelligence Module Homework and Notes

My cheatsheets, homework and any lab sessions.

Homeworks are a mixture of original work and referenced from https://github.com/yee-kevin/artificial-intelligence (mainly for the generative model homework). Please do not directly copy (from mine or Yee Kevin) as that is plagiarism.

Also, feel free to use the cheatsheets for your own reference, they are originals made by me.

Lab sessions are taken from class.
