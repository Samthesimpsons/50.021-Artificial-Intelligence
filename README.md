# 50.021 Artificial Intelligence
SUTD 50.021 Artificial Intelligence Module Homework and Notes

My cheatsheets, homework and any lab sessions.

Homeworks are a mixture of original work and referenced from https://github.com/yee-kevin/artificial-intelligence (mainly for the generative model homework). Please do not directly copy (from mine or Yee Kevin) as that is plagiarism.

Also, feel free to use the cheatsheets for your own reference, they are originals made by me. Do note the cheatsheet while very comprehensive assumes you know everything well. Things not included for eg. UCS example, full PDDL code for robot world (only partial included). Also MCQ quiz 2 implies escaping the lecture is not possible, everything can be tested.

Lab sessions are taken from class.
