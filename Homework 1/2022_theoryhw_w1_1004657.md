## Question 2 (Formulation)

> Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of the river. They all need to cross in a boat that only holds two people at once.  There must never be a situation where there is a group of missionaries in one place who areoutnumbered by cannibals.

Assuming they are crossing over from the left to the right side.

1. **Statespace:** <br>
[Number of missionaries yet to cross, Number of cannibals yet to cross, Current Boat location (0: right side, 1: left side)]
2. **Initial state:** <br>
Initially there are 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals who have yet to cross. The boat is on the left side. **[3,3,1]**
3. **Goal test** <br>
To obtain a goal state of **[0,0,0]** where there are 0 missionaries and cannibals who have yet to cross, hence implying all have crossed over. The boat is on the right side after ferrying the last group.
4. Actions  <br>
Actions are represented by [Number of missionaries crossing, Number of cannibals crossing, Where the boat is crossing from (0: right side, 1: left side)]
Given the scenario, there are 5 possible actions:
([])
5. Path cost

## Question 3 (General Search)

1. **Difference between a node and a state:** 

    A state which is a physical configuration does not have a parent, children, depth or path cost unlike a node which is a data structure constituting part of a search tree.

2. **Briefly describe what is a search strategy:**

    Starting at an intial, root node of the search tree, a search strategy is the picking of the order of the node expansion.

3. **Describe the difference between Tree Search and Graph Search:**

    During the node expasion, a tree search does not keep track of the previously visited states unlike a graph search.
